## How We Tested

Our team spent 150+ hours testing over 35 AI image generators across multiple criteria. Following our proven jilo.ai methodology, we evaluated each tool based on:

- **Image Quality**: Resolution, detail, coherence, and artistic fidelity
- **Prompt Adherence**: How accurately the tool follows text descriptions
- **Speed**: Generation time from prompt to finished image
- **Creative Control**: Editing tools, style options, and fine-tuning capabilities
- **Value for Money**: Cost per image, subscription value, and commercial licensing

Each generator was tested with identical prompts across categories: photorealism, illustration, product mockups, logos, and abstract art.

## FAQ

### Which AI image generator produces the most realistic photos?

Flux by Black Forest Labs and Midjourney V6 lead for photorealism. Flux excels at natural-looking photos, while Midjourney produces more stylized but incredibly detailed realistic images. For stock photo alternatives, Adobe Firefly's commercial licensing makes it the safest choice.

### Can I use AI-generated images commercially?

It depends on the tool. Adobe Firefly explicitly allows commercial use with clean IP. Midjourney, DALL·E 3, and most paid services include commercial licenses in their subscriptions. Open-source tools like Stable Diffusion have permissive licenses. Always check the specific terms of service.

### Do I need a powerful computer for AI image generation?

Only for local tools like Stable Diffusion, which benefits from an NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM. Cloud-based services (Midjourney, DALL·E 3, Adobe Firefly) run on their servers, so any device with a web browser works fine.

### How do I write better prompts for AI image generators?

Be specific about subject, style, lighting, composition, and mood. Include artist or photography references. Use negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements. Start simple and iterate. Each tool responds differently, so experiment with phrasing. DALL·E 3 understands natural language best, while Midjourney responds well to comma-separated descriptors.

### Will AI image generators replace graphic designers?

No, but they're transforming the design workflow. AI tools are best for ideation, concept exploration, and first drafts. Professional designers use them to accelerate their process, not replace their skills. Strategic thinking, brand understanding, and client communication remain uniquely human contributions.
