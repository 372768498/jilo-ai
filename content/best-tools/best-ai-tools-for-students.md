## FAQ

### Is using AI tools considered cheating in school?

It depends entirely on how you use them and your institution's policies. Using AI as a study aid — to understand concepts, generate practice problems, or organize notes — is generally acceptable. Using AI to write assignments you submit as your own work is considered academic dishonesty at most institutions. Always check your school's AI policy and ask professors when unsure.

### Which AI tools are best for non-native English speakers?

Grammarly and Quillbot are particularly valuable for non-native speakers. Grammarly's real-time corrections help improve English writing skills over time, while Quillbot's paraphrasing modes help express ideas more naturally. ChatGPT is also excellent for language practice and explaining nuanced English usage.

### Can AI tools actually help me learn, or just help me cheat?

The tools themselves are neutral — it's how you use them. AI tools that explain concepts (ChatGPT, Wolfram Alpha's step-by-step), improve your skills (Grammarly), or help you study more efficiently (Anki, Otter.ai) genuinely enhance learning. Tools used to generate work without understanding actively harm your education. The key question: "Am I using this to understand more, or to do less?"

### How much should students budget for AI tools?

Most students can get significant value for $0–20/month. Start with free tiers: ChatGPT Free, Grammarly Free, Quillbot Free, Notion (free student plan), and Anki. If you can afford $10–20/month, Grammarly Premium and ChatGPT Plus offer the most impactful upgrades. Always check for student discounts — most tools offer 30–50% off.

### Will professors know if I used AI to write my papers?

AI detection tools (Turnitin, GPTZero) are increasingly integrated into academic workflows and can identify AI-generated text with moderate accuracy. More importantly, professors often recognize AI writing from its distinctive patterns — lack of personal voice, overly smooth transitions, and generic examples. Rather than trying to evade detection, use AI for research, outlining, and editing while writing the actual content yourself.

## Methodology

Our review follows the jilo.ai standard evaluation framework. Each tool was tested by current students over 4+ weeks of actual coursework. We evaluated impact on study efficiency, grade outcomes, and genuine learning (not just task completion). Academic integrity was a primary consideration — tools that primarily enable cheating were excluded. Ratings reflect learning effectiveness (30%), academic integrity (25%), ease of use (20%), affordability (15%), and subject coverage (10%). All tools were re-evaluated in January 2026.
