## FAQ

### Is Perplexity AI better than Google?

For research and complex questions, yes — Perplexity provides better-sourced, more comprehensive answers. For everyday search (local businesses, navigation, shopping), Google remains superior due to its massive index and specialized features. Many users benefit from using both.

### Are AI search engines accurate?

AI search engines have improved dramatically but still occasionally produce errors. Perplexity's citation system helps you verify claims, while Google's AI Overviews leverage the world's largest knowledge graph. Always verify critical information, especially for medical, legal, or financial queries.

### Do AI search engines track my data?

It varies widely. Google and Bing collect extensive data. Brave Search collects nothing. Perplexity, You.com, and Kagi offer varying degrees of privacy protection. Check each engine's privacy policy for specifics. Using Brave Search with a VPN provides the maximum privacy combination.

### Can I use AI search engines for academic research?

Perplexity AI with Academic focus mode is excellent for finding scholarly sources. However, always verify citations against original papers. Google Scholar remains essential for comprehensive academic search. The best approach combines AI search for discovery with traditional databases for verification.

### Will AI search engines replace traditional search?

They're complementing rather than replacing traditional search. AI excels at synthesizing answers to complex questions, while traditional search is better for navigational queries, shopping, and local results. The trend is toward hybrid experiences — like Google's AI Overviews — that combine both approaches.
