## FAQ

### Are AI healthcare tools FDA-approved and safe to use?

The regulatory landscape varies by tool type. Diagnostic AI tools (like Viz.ai for imaging) typically require FDA clearance, which validates their safety and efficacy. Documentation tools (like DAX) don't require FDA clearance as they're classified as administrative. Always verify a tool's regulatory status before clinical use and never rely solely on AI for clinical decisions.

### How do AI tools handle patient data privacy (HIPAA)?

All reputable healthcare AI tools are HIPAA-compliant with Business Associate Agreements (BAAs). They use encryption for data in transit and at rest, limit data access to authorized personnel, and undergo regular security audits. However, practices should verify compliance independently, ensure BAAs are signed, and train staff on proper AI tool usage within privacy guidelines.

### Can AI replace doctors or nurses?

No. Current AI tools are designed to augment healthcare professionals, not replace them. AI excels at data processing (imaging analysis, documentation, pattern recognition) but cannot replace clinical judgment, patient relationships, physical examinations, or complex decision-making. The most effective implementations use AI to handle administrative burden so clinicians can focus on direct patient care.

### What's the ROI of implementing AI in a medical practice?

ROI varies by tool type. Documentation tools typically show ROI within 1–2 months through time savings (2–3 hours/day per clinician) and increased patient volume (2–4 additional patients/day). Clinical decision support tools improve revenue through better documentation and coding (10–20% improvement). Patient communication tools reduce no-shows (20–30% reduction) and improve outcomes that affect value-based payments.

### How should healthcare organizations evaluate AI vendors?

Prioritize: (1) clinical evidence — ask for peer-reviewed studies validating the tool's claims; (2) regulatory status — verify FDA clearance where applicable; (3) EHR integration — native integration beats copy-paste; (4) data security — demand SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA compliance documentation; (5) implementation support — healthcare AI requires clinical workflow redesign, not just software installation. Request references from similar-sized organizations in your specialty.
