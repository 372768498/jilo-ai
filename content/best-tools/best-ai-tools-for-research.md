## FAQ

### Is it ethical to use AI tools in academic research?

AI tools are increasingly accepted in research when used transparently and appropriately. Most institutions and journals permit AI use for literature search, language editing, and data analysis, but prohibit AI-generated text in manuscripts without disclosure. Always check your institution's AI policy, disclose AI use in your methodology section, and never present AI-generated content as original research or writing.

### Can AI tools replace the literature review process?

AI tools dramatically accelerate literature review but cannot replace critical evaluation. They excel at finding, organizing, and summarizing papers — reducing a weeks-long process to days. However, the critical analysis of methodology quality, identification of research gaps, and synthesis of findings into coherent arguments still require human expertise. Use AI to gather and organize; use your expertise to analyze and synthesize.

### How do I cite AI tools in my research papers?

Citation practices are evolving. APA 7th Edition recommends citing AI tools when they meaningfully contributed to your work, treating them as software. Include the tool name, version, developer, and how it was used. Major journals increasingly require disclosure of AI use in methodology sections. When in doubt, over-disclose — transparency protects your credibility.

### Which AI tools are best for systematic reviews?

For systematic reviews, use Elicit for structured data extraction, Consensus for evidence synthesis, and Connected Papers or Litmaps for comprehensive paper discovery. The combination of these tools can reduce systematic review timelines by 40–60% while improving comprehensiveness. Always verify AI-extracted data against original papers for accuracy.

### Are there AI tools for grant writing?

While no tool is specifically designed for grant writing, several can help significantly. Use Semantic Scholar and Elicit to strengthen your literature foundation, Writefull for manuscript-quality writing, and ChatGPT or Claude for brainstorming specific aims and refining language. The key is using AI for specific components (background research, language polishing) rather than generating entire proposals.

## Methodology

Our evaluation follows the jilo.ai standard framework with additional academic-specific criteria. Each tool was tested by active researchers over 8+ weeks on real research projects across STEM, social sciences, and humanities. We verified citation accuracy, measured time savings in literature review workflows, and assessed output quality against expert benchmarks. Academic integrity was a primary consideration — tools were evaluated for appropriate use within institutional policies. Ratings reflect research accuracy (30%), citation integrity (20%), workflow integration (20%), discipline coverage (15%), and academic ethics (15%). All tools were re-evaluated in January 2026.
