## FAQ

### Do AI coding tools make developers lazy or less skilled?

AI coding tools are best viewed as productivity enhancers rather than replacements for fundamental programming skills. They handle repetitive tasks and boilerplate code, allowing developers to focus on complex problem-solving and architecture. However, it's important to understand the generated code rather than blindly accepting suggestions.

### How accurate are AI code suggestions?

Accuracy varies by tool and context, but leading tools like Copilot achieve 35-50% acceptance rates for suggestions. Accuracy is highest for common patterns and popular languages, lower for niche libraries or complex logic. Always review and test generated code before production use.

### Can AI coding tools introduce security vulnerabilities?

Yes, AI tools can suggest code with security issues, especially if trained on codebases containing vulnerabilities. Use security-focused tools like Snyk alongside general coding assistants, and maintain security code review practices. Never bypass security testing for AI-generated code.

### Which tool is best for learning programming?

Replit Ghostwriter and GitHub Copilot are excellent for learning, as they provide real-time feedback and can explain code suggestions. ChatGPT Plus or Claude are also valuable for asking questions about programming concepts and debugging help.

### Are AI coding tools worth the cost for freelancers?

For active developers, AI tools typically pay for themselves within days through increased productivity. Even a 20% speed increase justifies a $10-20/month cost for most freelancers. Start with free tiers to measure your productivity gains before committing to paid plans.
