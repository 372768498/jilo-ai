## FAQ

### Do AI meeting assistants record my meetings without consent?

Most AI meeting assistants notify participants when recording starts, either through a visible bot joining the meeting or an in-meeting notification. Many jurisdictions require consent for recording. Always check your local laws and inform meeting participants. Most tools provide customizable notification settings.

### How accurate are AI meeting transcriptions?

In our testing, the best tools (Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai) achieve 90-95% accuracy in optimal conditions. Accuracy drops with poor audio quality, heavy accents, multiple overlapping speakers, and technical jargon. Custom vocabulary features can improve accuracy for specialized terms.

### Can AI meeting assistants work with in-person meetings?

Yes, most tools can transcribe in-person meetings when used with a microphone. Otter.ai and Krisp work well with laptop or phone microphones. However, speaker identification and accuracy are reduced compared to virtual meetings where each speaker has their own audio feed.

### Will my meeting data be secure?

Enterprise-grade tools (Otter.ai Business, Fireflies.ai Business, Avoma) offer SOC 2 compliance, encryption at rest and in transit, and data retention controls. Always review the security certifications and data handling policies. For sensitive meetings, consider tools that offer on-premise processing or data residency options.

### Are AI meeting summaries good enough to skip meetings?

AI summaries capture key decisions and action items well, making them useful for catching up on meetings you missed. However, they don't capture nuance, body language, or the full context of discussions. For important meetings where you need to contribute, there's no substitute for attendance. Use summaries as a complement, not a replacement.
