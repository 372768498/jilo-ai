## FAQ

### Can AI video tools replace professional video production?

AI tools excel at specific tasks like presenter videos, content repurposing, and basic animations, but professional production involving complex cinematography, creative direction, and client consultation still requires human expertise. AI tools are best viewed as powerful assistants that enhance productivity.

### What's the typical quality difference between AI and traditional video?

AI tools produce professional-looking results for specific use cases (talking heads, explainers, social content) but may lack the nuanced creativity and technical precision of traditional production. Quality varies significantly by tool and application, with some AI outputs indistinguishable from traditional methods.

### How long does it take to create videos with AI tools?

Simple videos can be generated in minutes, while complex productions may take several hours including editing and refinement. Most AI tools significantly reduce production time compared to traditional methods, often by 70-90% for appropriate use cases.
