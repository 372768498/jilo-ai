## How We Chose

We tested each tool by creating resumes for three different job types (tech, marketing, finance) and evaluated: AI quality, ATS compatibility, template design, ease of use, and value for money.

## FAQ

### Are AI resumes detected by employers?
No. AI resume builders help with formatting, keyword optimization, and content suggestions. The final resume looks like any professionally written resume. However, always personalize the content with your actual experience.

### Is it worth paying for a resume builder?
If you're actively job hunting, yes. The $5-29/month cost pays for itself with better interview rates. For one-off resume updates, the free tiers are usually sufficient.

### Do these tools work for entry-level positions?
Absolutely. Tools like Rezi and Teal are particularly good at highlighting transferable skills and education for entry-level candidates. They help you optimize limited experience effectively.

### Can I use AI to write my cover letter too?
Yes, most tools include cover letter builders. Teal and Kickresume offer the best AI cover letter features, tailoring each letter to the specific job description.

### Which format should I use — PDF or Word?
PDF preserves formatting and is preferred by most employers. However, some older ATS systems read Word (.docx) better. When in doubt, submit PDF unless the job posting specifically requests Word format.
