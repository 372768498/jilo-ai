## FAQ

### Can AI really predict home prices accurately?

Modern AI valuation models (AVMs) achieve median error rates of 2–5% for standard residential properties. Accuracy is highest for typical homes in active markets with abundant comparable sales data. Unique properties, luxury homes, and thin markets see significantly higher error rates. AI valuations are best used as starting points for pricing discussions, not final determinations.

### Will AI replace real estate agents?

No. While AI automates many tasks agents currently perform (lead generation, marketing, scheduling, valuation estimates), the relationship-driven nature of real estate transactions means human agents remain essential. AI tools make agents more efficient and effective, but the trust, negotiation, and emotional support involved in buying and selling homes require human connection.

### How much should agents budget for AI tools?

Solo agents should budget $200–500/month for essential AI tools (CRM, marketing, virtual tours). Teams should budget $500–2,000/month depending on size. Start with the highest-impact tools: a good AI CRM ($100–200/month), listing description tool ($50/month), and virtual tour platform ($12–32/month). Scale up based on measurable ROI.

### Is AI-generated listing content effective for SEO?

Yes, when done properly. AI-generated listing descriptions that include relevant keywords, neighborhood information, and unique property features perform well in search results. The key is customization — avoid publishing generic AI output. Add specific details about the property and local area that AI can't know. Unique, detailed content consistently outranks thin, templated descriptions.

### What's the biggest ROI opportunity with AI in real estate?

Lead response speed and nurture. Studies show that responding to leads within 5 minutes increases conversion rates by 100x compared to 30-minute responses. AI-powered CRMs and lead qualification tools ensure instant responses 24/7, which is the single highest-ROI investment for most agents. Second highest is predictive analytics for identifying likely sellers.
