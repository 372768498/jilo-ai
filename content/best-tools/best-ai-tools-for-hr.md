## FAQ

### Is it legal to use AI in hiring decisions?

AI use in hiring is legal but increasingly regulated. Key regulations include NYC's Local Law 144 (requiring bias audits for automated employment decision tools), the EU AI Act (classifying hiring AI as high-risk), and EEOC guidance on AI and discrimination. Organizations should ensure their AI tools undergo regular bias audits, maintain human oversight of AI recommendations, and comply with local regulations.

### Can AI eliminate bias in hiring?

AI can reduce but not eliminate hiring bias. Well-designed AI tools remove some human biases (name, photo, school prestige) but can introduce others if trained on biased historical data. The best approach combines AI tools with bias auditing (like Textio for language), structured interviews (like HireVue), and human oversight to catch AI blind spots.

### How do employees feel about AI in HR?

Employee sentiment varies. Most employees welcome AI that makes their lives easier (automated scheduling, instant HR answers, streamlined performance reviews). Resistance typically arises when AI feels like surveillance (keystroke monitoring, sentiment analysis of communications) or when AI makes decisions without human oversight (automated performance ratings). Transparency about what AI does and doesn't do is critical.

### What's the ROI of AI in recruiting?

AI recruiting tools typically deliver 30–50% reduction in time-to-hire, 20–40% reduction in cost-per-hire, and 15–25% improvement in quality-of-hire metrics. For a company making 100 hires/year with a $5,000 average cost-per-hire, a 30% reduction saves $150,000 annually — far exceeding the cost of most AI tools.

### Should small companies invest in AI HR tools?

Start with high-impact, affordable tools: Fetcher for sourcing ($149/month), Lattice for performance management ($11/person/month), and Textio alternatives for job posting optimization. Avoid enterprise platforms until you have 200+ employees. Many tools offer startup or small business programs with reduced pricing. The biggest wins for small companies are automating scheduling and sourcing.

## Methodology

Our evaluation follows the jilo.ai standard framework with additional HR-specific criteria. Each tool was assessed by HR professionals over 6+ weeks in real hiring and management scenarios. We measured time savings, candidate/employee satisfaction, diversity impact, and integration ease. Bias testing was conducted using diverse candidate profiles across all screening tools. Ratings reflect hiring efficiency (25%), bias mitigation (25%), employee experience (20%), integration (15%), and compliance (15%). All tools were re-evaluated in January 2026.
