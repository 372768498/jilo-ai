## How We Tested

Our team spent 100+ hours testing over 25 AI presentation tools across multiple criteria. Following our proven jilo.ai methodology, we evaluated each tool based on:

- **Design Quality**: Visual appeal, layout intelligence, and professional polish
- **Speed**: Time from idea to finished presentation
- **Customization**: Template variety, branding options, and editing flexibility
- **AI Intelligence**: Content generation, design suggestions, and automation quality
- **Collaboration**: Team features, sharing, and export options

Each tool was tested by creating identical presentations: a startup pitch deck, a quarterly business review, an educational lecture, and a product launch.

## FAQ

### Can AI really create a good presentation?

Yes, AI presentation tools can generate solid first drafts in minutes. Gamma and Tome produce presentations that are 70-80% ready for use. However, the best results come from using AI for the initial draft and then customizing content, adjusting visuals, and refining messaging to your specific audience.

### Should I use AI presentations for investor pitches?

AI tools are excellent for creating pitch deck drafts quickly. Slidebean and Tome are specifically designed for this. However, investor presentations should always be carefully reviewed and customized. Use AI for structure and design, but ensure your story, data, and messaging are hand-crafted for your audience.

### How do AI presentation tools compare to hiring a designer?

AI tools can replace designers for routine internal presentations and first drafts, saving $200-500 per deck. For high-stakes presentations (keynotes, major pitches, client proposals), a professional designer still delivers superior results. Many teams use AI for 80% of presentations and designers for the remaining 20%.

### Can I export AI presentations to PowerPoint?

Most AI presentation tools support PowerPoint export. Gamma, Beautiful.ai, and Canva all export to .pptx format. However, some design elements and animations may not translate perfectly. If PowerPoint compatibility is critical, Beautiful.ai and Canva handle exports best.
