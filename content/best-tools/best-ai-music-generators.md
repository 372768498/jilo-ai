## How We Tested

Our team spent 120+ hours testing over 20 AI music generators across multiple criteria. Following our proven jilo.ai methodology, we evaluated each tool based on:

- **Audio Quality**: Production value, clarity, and professional-grade output
- **Musical Coherence**: Structure, melody, and arrangement quality
- **Customization**: Genre, mood, tempo, instrumentation, and style control
- **Commercial Licensing**: Rights clarity for business and content use
- **Ease of Use**: From prompt to finished track experience

Each generator was tested by creating identical requests: a pop song with vocals, a cinematic soundtrack, a lo-fi beat, an electronic track, and ambient background music.

## FAQ

### Can AI-generated music be used commercially?

Yes, but licensing varies by tool and plan. Mubert, Soundraw, and Suno (paid plans) offer clear commercial licenses. AIVA requires the Pro plan for full ownership. Always check the specific licensing terms for your plan — free tiers typically allow personal use only.

### Will AI music generators replace musicians?

No. AI music generators are powerful tools for inspiration, prototyping, and content creation, but they lack the emotional depth, cultural understanding, and artistic vision of human musicians. Professional musicians increasingly use AI as a creative partner rather than viewing it as a replacement.

### How good is AI-generated music quality?

Suno and Udio produce music that's genuinely enjoyable to listen to, with quality approaching amateur professional production. For background and functional music, AI output is essentially indistinguishable from stock music libraries. However, the most discerning listeners can still identify AI-generated music by its structural patterns.

### Can I upload AI-generated music to Spotify?

Yes, through services like Boomy (which has built-in distribution) or third-party distributors like DistroKid. However, streaming platforms are developing policies around AI content. Some require disclosure of AI generation, and policies continue to evolve. Check current platform guidelines before distributing.

### Do I need music knowledge to use AI music generators?

No. Tools like Suno and Boomy require zero musical knowledge — you describe what you want in plain English. However, understanding music terminology (genre, tempo, key, mood) helps you get better results. AIVA and Soundraw benefit more from music knowledge due to their detailed customization options.
