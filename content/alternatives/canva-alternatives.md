## FAQ

### Is Figma a direct replacement for Canva?

Figma serves different needs than Canva. While Canva focuses on template-based design for quick content creation, Figma is designed for custom UI/UX design and collaborative design systems. Figma requires more design knowledge but offers unlimited creative control.

### Which alternative offers the best free tier?

Adobe Express and Figma offer the most robust free tiers. Adobe Express includes access to Adobe Stock assets, while Figma provides full design capabilities for up to 3 projects. VistaCreate also offers a generous free tier with animation features.

### Can I import my Canva designs to other tools?

Most alternatives support common file formats (PNG, JPG, PDF, SVG), so you can export from Canva and import basic elements. However, editable template features won't transfer, so you'll need to recreate complex designs in your new tool.

### Which tool is best for non-designers?

Adobe Express and VistaCreate offer the closest user-friendly experience to Canva while providing additional professional features. They maintain template-based workflows that don't require design expertise but offer more advanced capabilities.

### Are there any free alternatives that match Canva's capabilities?

While no free tool matches Canva Pro's full feature set, Adobe Express (free tier), Figma (free tier), and VistaCreate (free tier) come close. The combination of these free tools can often provide more capabilities than Canva Pro, though with a steeper learning curve.
