## FAQ

### Is DeepSeek really as good as GPT-4?

DeepSeek's models (especially DeepSeek-V3 and R1) perform competitively on many benchmarks, particularly in math, coding, and reasoning. However, GPT-4 and Claude still lead in areas like instruction following, creative writing, and multimodal tasks. Performance varies by use case.

### Can I self-host DeepSeek alternatives?

Yes — Llama, Mistral, Qwen, and Yi all offer open-weight models you can run on your own hardware. This gives you full data control and eliminates API costs, though you'll need capable GPUs for larger models.

### Which alternative is best for coding?

Claude and ChatGPT are top choices for general coding assistance. For open-source self-hosting, Qwen 2.5 Coder and Llama models are strong contenders that rival DeepSeek Coder on benchmarks.

### Are there privacy concerns with DeepSeek?

Some organizations have concerns about data handling by China-based AI services. Alternatives like Claude, Mistral (EU-based), or self-hosted Llama models offer different data residency and privacy guarantees that may better suit compliance requirements.

### Which is the most cost-effective alternative?

For API usage, Mistral and Qwen offer competitive pricing. For zero API cost, self-hosting Llama or Qwen models is the most economical long-term. For consumer use, Gemini and Claude offer generous free tiers.
