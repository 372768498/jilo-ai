## Why Look for ClickUp Alternatives?

ClickUp positions itself as "one app to replace them all" for project management. While feature-rich, users often seek alternatives for practical reasons:

- **Overwhelming complexity** — The sheer number of features creates a steep learning curve
- **Performance issues** — The app can feel sluggish, especially with large workspaces
- **Feature bloat** — Many teams only need simple task management, not 100+ features
- **Mobile experience** — The mobile app doesn't match the desktop experience
- **Reliability concerns** — Occasional downtime and sync issues frustrate teams
- **Opinionated workflows** — Some teams prefer tools built for specific methodologies
- **Onboarding friction** — New team members struggle to get up to speed quickly
