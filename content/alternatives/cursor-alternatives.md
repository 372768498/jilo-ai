## Why Look for Cursor Alternatives?

Cursor has become a leading AI-powered code editor, but developers often explore alternatives for several reasons:

- **Subscription cost** — Pro plan pricing may not suit solo developers or students
- **IDE preference** — Some developers are deeply invested in VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim ecosystems
- **Privacy concerns** — Sending code to cloud APIs isn't acceptable for every team
- **Feature gaps** — Need for specialized language support or unique workflow integrations
- **Performance** — Heavier AI features can slow down large codebases
- **Team licensing** — Enterprise plans may be more affordable elsewhere
