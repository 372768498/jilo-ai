## FAQ

### Can AI presentation tools replace professional designers?

For internal presentations, pitch decks, and educational content, AI tools like Gamma and its alternatives produce professional-quality results. For high-stakes keynotes, brand launches, or investor presentations, AI tools serve as excellent starting points that designers can refine. The quality gap is narrowing rapidly.

### Which alternative works best with PowerPoint?

Beautiful.ai and Canva both offer clean PowerPoint export. SlidesAI works within Google Slides, which can export to .pptx. For direct PowerPoint integration, Microsoft Copilot (built into PowerPoint) is worth considering, though it requires a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.

### Is there a free alternative to Gamma?

Several alternatives offer free tiers: Canva Presentations, Prezi (Basic), Pitch, SlidesAI (3 presentations/month), and Tome all have free plans. Slidev is completely free and open source. For the most capable free option, Canva Presentations offers the best balance of features and generosity.

### Which tool is best for sales and pitch decks?

Tome excels at narrative-driven pitch decks with engagement analytics. Decktopus offers built-in forms and lead capture specifically for sales presentations. Beautiful.ai ensures consistently polished decks. For data-heavy investor decks, Pitch's clean design and analytics provide professional results.

### Can I import existing presentations into these tools?

Prezi can import and transform PowerPoint files. Canva supports PowerPoint import. Beautiful.ai allows PowerPoint upload for redesign. Most AI tools work best when generating fresh content rather than reformatting existing slides, so consider starting from scratch with AI assistance for the best results.
