## Why Look for Bolt.new Alternatives?

Bolt.new by StackBlitz popularized the idea of prompt-to-full-stack-app development, but users encounter limitations that drive them to seek alternatives:

- **Token consumption** — Complex apps burn through token allowances quickly, making costs unpredictable
- **Code quality issues** — Generated code often needs significant refactoring, especially for larger projects
- **Debugging difficulties** — When AI-generated code breaks, diagnosing issues in unfamiliar generated code is challenging
- **Scalability limits** — Projects beyond a certain complexity become unwieldy within the browser environment
- **Framework preferences** — While multi-framework, Bolt.new's output quality varies by stack
- **Backend limitations** — Database and API generation, while supported, can produce fragile implementations
- **Version control** — Managing code iterations and rollbacks is less robust than traditional development workflows

## FAQ

### Can AI app builders create production-ready applications?

For simple to moderately complex applications (landing pages, CRUD apps, dashboards, internal tools), AI builders like Bolt.new and Lovable can produce deployable results. For applications requiring complex business logic, high security, performance optimization, or regulatory compliance, AI-generated code should be treated as a starting point that needs professional developer review and refinement.

### How do Bolt.new alternatives handle databases?

Lovable and Softgen use Firebase/Supabase for built-in database functionality. Replit Agent uses Replit DB or can connect to external databases. Cursor and Windsurf let you work with any database through your own code. Create.xyz has a built-in database. v0 doesn't handle databases — it's frontend-only.

### Is it better to use an AI app builder or an AI-powered IDE?

It depends on your skills and goals. AI app builders (Bolt.new, Lovable, Replit Agent) are better for non-developers and rapid prototyping. AI-powered IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf) are better for experienced developers building production applications. Many teams use both — AI builders for initial prototypes, then IDEs for production development.

### What about security in AI-generated applications?

AI-generated code frequently contains security vulnerabilities including hardcoded credentials, missing input validation, SQL injection vectors, and insufficient access control. Always conduct a security review before deploying AI-generated code. For applications handling sensitive data, engage a security professional regardless of how the code was generated.

### Can I migrate my project away from these platforms?

Most tools offer GitHub export (Lovable, Softgen, Bolt.new) or work with standard code (Cursor, Windsurf, v0). Replit and Create.xyz have more lock-in since they bundle hosting with development. Always evaluate export capabilities before committing to a platform for an important project.
