## Overview

CapCut has become one of the most popular free video editors, especially among social media creators and TikTok users. Developed by ByteDance, it offers a surprisingly capable editing experience with trendy effects, auto-captions, and an intuitive timeline — all at no cost. Its mobile and desktop apps make it accessible to creators at every level.
