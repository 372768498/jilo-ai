## FAQ

### How does video quality compare to Runway?

Pika Labs offers comparable quality to Runway for text-to-video generation, often with better consistency. Stable Video Diffusion can match or exceed quality when properly configured. For specific use cases like avatars, D-ID and HeyGen provide superior results in their domains.

### Which alternative offers the longest video duration?

Most alternatives have similar duration limits (4-10 seconds for AI generation). Fliki and Pictory excel at longer-form content by combining multiple clips and techniques. For truly long videos, template-based tools like InVideo AI are more suitable than pure AI generation.

### Are there alternatives that work completely offline?

Stable Video Diffusion is the primary open-source option that can run completely offline with sufficient hardware (high-end GPU recommended). Other alternatives are primarily cloud-based for computational efficiency.

### Which tool is best for commercial use?

Most alternatives offer commercial licensing, but terms vary. HeyGen and Synthesia provide clear commercial usage rights for business content. Always review specific licensing terms, especially for avatar-based content which may have additional restrictions.

### How do costs compare for heavy usage?

For high-volume production, per-second pricing varies significantly. D-ID offers competitive rates for avatar content, while Pika Labs provides good value for creative generation. Stable Video Diffusion has no usage costs once deployed, making it most economical for heavy users with technical capabilities.
