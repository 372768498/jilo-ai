## Why Look for Figma Alternatives?

Figma is the industry-standard collaborative design tool, but designers explore alternatives for several reasons:

- **Pricing increases** — Recent pricing changes have made Figma expensive for small teams
- **AI features** — Newer tools offer more advanced AI-powered design capabilities
- **Offline access** — Figma requires an internet connection; some need offline design tools
- **Platform preference** — Need native desktop apps with better performance for large files
- **Specialization** — Require tools focused on specific design types (websites, presentations, etc.)
- **Ownership concerns** — Prefer open-source or non-subscription tools

## FAQ

### Can any tool fully replace Figma?

Penpot comes closest as a direct open-source replacement with real-time collaboration, components, and design systems. Framer is a strong alternative if your focus is web design. For pure UI design on Mac, Sketch remains excellent. No single tool matches Figma's entire ecosystem yet, but the gap is closing.

### Which Figma alternative has the best AI features?

Galileo AI leads in AI-native design generation. Uizard excels at converting sketches and screenshots to editable designs. Framer offers AI website generation. Canva's Magic Design generates layouts from prompts. Lunacy includes AI background removal and upscaling.

### Is Penpot really free? What's the catch?

Penpot is genuinely free and open-source under the Mozilla Public License. There's no catch — it's funded by Kaleidos and the community. You can self-host it for complete control, or use their free cloud service. They plan to offer premium enterprise features eventually.

### Which alternative is best for design systems?

Figma remains the gold standard for design systems, but Penpot, Sketch, and Framer all support component libraries and design tokens. Sketch's Symbols and Libraries system is particularly mature for design system management.

### Can I import my Figma files into alternatives?

Penpot, Lunacy, and Framer support Figma file import. Sketch offers a Figma importer plugin. Most tools support SVG import as a universal fallback. The quality of imported files varies — complex components and auto-layout may need manual adjustment.
