## FAQ

### Is DeepL really better than Google Translate?

DeepL generally produces more natural-sounding translations for European languages, particularly German, French, and Spanish. However, Google Translate supports far more languages and has better real-time features. For Asian languages, Google Translate and Papago often outperform DeepL.

### Can AI chatbots like ChatGPT replace DeepL?

For many use cases, yes. LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude excel at contextual, nuanced translation and can adapt tone and style. However, they're slower for bulk translation, more expensive at scale, and less consistent. DeepL remains better for high-volume, straightforward document translation.

### Which alternative is best for translating documents?

For occasional document translation, Google Translate and Microsoft Translator handle common formats well. For professional quality, Smartcat and Trados combine machine translation with human review workflows. Phrase is best for enterprise-scale document localization.

### What's the best free DeepL alternative?

Google Translate offers the best free experience with 130+ languages, camera translation, and conversation mode. Lingva Translate is the best privacy-focused free option. Papago is the best free option for Asian language pairs.

### Which tool is best for website localization?

Lokalise and Phrase are purpose-built for software and website localization with developer integrations. For simpler websites, Smartcat offers good localization workflows. Google Cloud Translation API is the most cost-effective for programmatic website translation.
