## Why Look for v0 Alternatives?

Vercel's v0 pioneered prompt-to-UI generation for React developers, but users have good reasons to explore alternatives:

- **Framework lock-in** — v0 generates primarily React/Next.js code with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, limiting flexibility
- **Credit limitations** — Free tier is restrictive, and even paid plans have generation caps
- **Code quality concerns** — Generated code sometimes needs significant refactoring for production use
- **Limited full-stack capability** — v0 focuses on frontend UI; backend logic requires additional tools
- **Design customization** — Output adheres closely to shadcn/ui aesthetics, which may not match your brand
- **Learning curve** — Effective prompting requires understanding of React and component architecture
- **No deployment pipeline** — Generates code but doesn't handle hosting or deployment directly

## FAQ

### Can v0 alternatives generate production-ready code?

It varies significantly. Bolt.new and Lovable generate functional applications that can be deployed directly, though complex apps may need refactoring. Cursor helps you write production code with AI assistance. Webflow and Framer produce production-ready websites but in their own formats. For enterprise-grade applications, all AI-generated code should be reviewed by experienced developers.

### Which alternative is best if I don't know React?

Lovable and Webflow AI are the most accessible for non-developers. Bolt.new supports multiple frameworks and can generate code in Vue or Svelte if you prefer. Framer requires no coding knowledge at all for marketing sites. If you want to learn while building, Cursor's explanations and suggestions are excellent educational tools.

### Can these tools replace a web developer?

For simple websites and MVPs, tools like Lovable, Bolt.new, and Framer can genuinely replace traditional development. For complex applications with custom business logic, authentication flows, performance requirements, and security needs, AI tools dramatically accelerate development but don't eliminate the need for developer expertise.

### How do AI website builders handle responsive design?

Most handle it reasonably well. Webflow and Framer give you visual breakpoint editing. Bolt.new and Lovable generate responsive CSS (usually via Tailwind). v0 generates responsive components by default. The quality of responsive output varies — always test on actual devices before shipping.

### Is it safe to use AI-generated code in production?

AI-generated code should be treated like code from a junior developer — review it carefully. Common issues include security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS), performance problems, accessibility gaps, and hardcoded values. Use AI generation for the initial scaffold, then review, test, and refine before deploying to production.
