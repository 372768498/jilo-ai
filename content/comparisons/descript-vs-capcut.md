## FAQ

### Is Descript good for YouTube videos?

Yes, Descript excels at YouTube content creation. Its text-based editing makes cutting long recordings fast, Studio Sound improves audio quality, and AI eye contact correction makes screen recordings look more professional. Many YouTubers use Descript for editing talking-head videos, tutorials, and podcast-style content.

### Can CapCut handle professional video editing?

CapCut has evolved significantly and can handle semi-professional editing tasks. It supports multi-track editing, keyframe animation, color grading, and 4K export. However, for advanced workflows like multi-cam editing, complex audio mixing, or broadcast-quality production, dedicated professional editors like Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve are still superior.

### Which tool has better AI captions/subtitles?

Both offer excellent AI-generated captions. Descript's transcription is highly accurate and allows you to edit captions by editing the transcript. CapCut's auto-captions feature offers more visual style options with animated, trendy subtitle designs popular on social media. For accuracy, Descript edges ahead; for visual appeal, CapCut wins.

### Can I use Descript's AI voice clone commercially?

Yes, Descript's Overdub feature creates a voice clone that you can use in commercial projects. You need to train the model with your own voice and consent to the terms. It's designed for making corrections (replacing misspoken words) and generating new narration, not for impersonating others.

### Which is better for a one-person content creator?

If you primarily make short-form social media content, CapCut's free tier, mobile app, and template library make it the practical choice. If you create long-form content like podcasts, YouTube videos, or online courses, Descript's text-based editing and audio tools will save you significant time despite the higher cost.
