## FAQ

### Which sounds more human?

ElevenLabs consistently produces the most natural-sounding AI voices available. Their voices handle emotional nuance, breathing patterns, and conversational rhythm better than any competitor. Murf sounds professional and clean but is more identifiable as AI in direct comparisons.

### Can I clone my own voice?

ElevenLabs offers instant voice cloning with as little as one minute of sample audio, available starting from the Starter plan ($5/month). Murf offers voice cloning only on Enterprise plans with longer sample requirements.

### Which is better for audiobook narration?

ElevenLabs is the clear choice for audiobooks. Its Projects feature lets you manage long-form content with multiple speakers, and the voice quality is closest to professional human narrators. ElevenLabs has partnerships with major audiobook platforms.

### Do they support real-time voice generation?

ElevenLabs supports real-time streaming via WebSocket connections, making it suitable for conversational AI, live translation, and interactive applications. Murf is primarily designed for pre-recorded content production, not real-time use cases.

### Are there ethical guidelines for voice cloning?

Both platforms have policies against creating voices without consent. ElevenLabs requires verification for professional voice cloning and has detection tools to identify AI-generated audio. Always ensure you have permission before cloning someone's voice.
