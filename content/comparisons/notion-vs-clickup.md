## FAQ

### Can Notion replace ClickUp for project management?
For simple projects, yes. Notion's databases can handle basic task management. But for complex projects with dependencies, time tracking, sprints, and resource allocation, ClickUp is significantly more capable.

### Can ClickUp replace Notion for docs?
ClickUp Docs has improved but still lacks Notion's flexibility and elegance. For a team wiki or knowledge base, Notion provides a better experience. Many teams use ClickUp for tasks and Notion for docs.

### Which has better AI features?
Both are comparable. Notion AI is better for writing and database automation. ClickUp Brain is better for project management intelligence (auto-standups, progress tracking). The AI gap is minimal.

### Which is easier to learn?
ClickUp has more features out of the box, which means a steeper learning curve. Notion's flexibility means you build your own system, which takes time but results in a tool perfectly fitted to your needs.

### Can I migrate between them?
Both offer import tools. Notion can import from Trello, Asana, and others. ClickUp can import from virtually any tool. Moving a large workspace is time-consuming regardless of direction.

## Final Verdict

**Notion** is the better choice for teams that prioritize documentation, knowledge management, and flexible workflows. **ClickUp** wins for teams that need powerful project management, time tracking, and structured task workflows. Many organizations use both — Notion as the knowledge base and ClickUp for execution. If you must choose one, pick based on whether your work is document-centric (Notion) or task-centric (ClickUp).
