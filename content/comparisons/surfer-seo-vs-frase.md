Surfer SEO's Content Score has a stronger correlation with rankings based on user data. However, both tools significantly improve content performance compared to writing without optimization.

### Can beginners use these tools?
Frase is slightly more beginner-friendly with its clean interface and content brief feature. Surfer SEO has more features, which can be overwhelming initially but offers more power once learned.

### Do they work for non-English content?
Both support multiple languages. Surfer SEO has broader language support and more refined NLP analysis for non-English content.

Yes, both offer content audit features. Paste your existing URL and get recommendations for improvement. This is one of the highest-ROI uses of either tool.

### Is the AI-generated content any good?
Surfer AI produces well-optimized content but may need editing for voice and accuracy. Frase's AI writer is decent for first drafts. Neither replaces human editing entirely.

## Final Verdict

**Surfer SEO** is the premium choice for serious content marketers and agencies who need the most comprehensive optimization tool. **Frase** is the smart choice for freelancers, bloggers, and small teams who need solid optimization at a fraction of the price.
