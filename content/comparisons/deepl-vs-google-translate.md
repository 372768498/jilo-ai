## FAQ

### Is DeepL really better than Google Translate?

For supported languages, particularly European language pairs, DeepL consistently produces more natural and fluent translations. Blind tests frequently show users preferring DeepL output. However, Google Translate covers far more languages and is better for less common language pairs where DeepL isn't available.

### Can I use DeepL for free?

Yes, DeepL offers a free tier with 500,000 characters per month and 3 document translations. The free web interface allows unlimited short text translations. For higher volumes or API access, paid plans start at $9/month.

### Which is better for business translation?

DeepL is generally preferred for business use due to its higher translation quality, glossary features for terminology consistency, and document translation with formatting preservation. Many enterprises use DeepL for customer-facing content and Google Translate for internal quick translations.

### Does Google Translate work offline?

Yes, Google Translate offers offline translation for many languages on its mobile app. You need to download language packs in advance. DeepL requires an internet connection for all translations.

### Are machine translations accurate enough for legal documents?

Neither tool should be used as the sole translation for legal documents. Both can produce excellent drafts, but legal translations require professional human review. DeepL's glossary feature helps maintain consistent legal terminology, making it a better starting point for professional translators.
