## Overview

Meeting transcription has become a core productivity tool, and Fireflies.ai and Otter.ai are the two leading AI-powered solutions. Both automatically join your video calls, transcribe conversations in real time, and generate summaries—but they differ meaningfully in integrations, team features, and target audience.

**Fireflies.ai** is built for teams and workflows. It emphasizes CRM integration, conversation intelligence, and cross-platform compatibility. It works with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and dozens of other conferencing tools, then pushes insights into Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Notion, and more.

**Otter.ai** focuses on being the best real-time transcription experience. Its live transcript is fast and accurate, and it integrates deeply with Zoom and Microsoft 365. Otter is popular with journalists, students, and professionals who need a reliable personal transcription tool.

Both offer generous free tiers, making it easy to try before you buy.

## Feature Comparison

### Transcription Accuracy

Both platforms deliver strong accuracy in the 90-95% range for clear English audio with minimal background noise. Otter.ai has a slight edge in real-time transcription speed—the live transcript appears almost instantly during calls, which is useful for following along in real time.

Fireflies.ai performs comparably on recorded transcripts and handles multi-speaker identification well. Its accuracy improves further with its custom vocabulary feature, which lets you train the system on industry-specific jargon and proper nouns.

**Winner: Otter.ai** — Marginally faster real-time transcription with excellent speaker identification. The difference is small but noticeable in live settings.

### Integrations & Workflow Automation

Fireflies.ai dominates in integrations. It connects natively with Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Slack, Notion, Asana, Trello, Zapier, and many more. After every meeting, you can automatically push transcripts, action items, and summaries to your CRM, project management tool, or team channel. The AskFred AI chatbot lets you query across all your past meetings.

Otter.ai integrates with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Dropbox, and a few other tools. Its Otter for Sales feature pushes call insights to Salesforce. The integration ecosystem is growing but remains narrower than Fireflies.

**Winner: Fireflies.ai** — Significantly broader integration ecosystem, especially for CRM and project management workflows.

### Team & Collaboration Features

Fireflies.ai is designed for team use. Shared meeting libraries, channel-based organization, comment threads on specific transcript moments, and usage analytics for managers make it a strong fit for sales teams, customer success departments, and agencies. The Business plan includes conversation intelligence metrics like talk-to-listen ratios and sentiment analysis.

Otter.ai offers shared workspaces, collaborative note-editing during live meetings, and the ability to highlight and comment on transcript sections. Its real-time collaboration during meetings—where multiple participants can add notes alongside the live transcript—is a unique and genuinely useful feature.

**Winner: Fireflies.ai** — More comprehensive team management and conversation analytics, though Otter's live collaboration is excellent.

### AI Summaries & Action Items

Both tools generate AI-powered meeting summaries with key topics, action items, and decisions. Fireflies organizes summaries into categories (action items, questions, metrics, sentiment) and lets you filter by speaker or topic. The summaries are detailed and well-structured.

Otter.ai's AI Chat feature lets you ask questions about the meeting transcript conversationally. Its summaries are concise and actionable, with automatic action item extraction. The OtterPilot feature can auto-join meetings and email summaries to participants afterward.

**Winner: Tie** — Both produce excellent summaries. Fireflies offers more structured categorization; Otter offers more natural conversational querying.

## FAQ

**Q: Which tool has better accuracy for accented English?**
A: Both handle standard accents well. Fireflies.ai's custom vocabulary feature helps with specialized terms, which indirectly improves accuracy for domain-specific conversations. Neither tool is significantly better than the other for heavy accents.

**Q: Can these tools transcribe pre-recorded audio files?**
A: Yes, both support uploading audio and video files for transcription. Fireflies supports more file formats and allows bulk uploads on paid plans.

**Q: Do they work with phone calls, not just video meetings?**
A: Fireflies offers a dial-in feature and can transcribe phone calls. Otter supports phone call transcription through its mobile app. Fireflies is more flexible for non-video-call use cases.

**Q: How secure are the transcripts?**
A: Both platforms offer encryption at rest and in transit. Fireflies provides SOC 2 Type II compliance on Business plans and above. Otter offers SOC 2 compliance and HIPAA-compliant options on Enterprise plans. Always review their current security documentation for sensitive meetings.

**Q: Can I use both tools simultaneously on the same call?**
A: Technically yes, but it's unnecessary and may confuse participants if two bot attendees join. Pick one per meeting. If you're evaluating both, alternate between calls.

## Final Verdict

**Fireflies.ai** is the stronger choice for teams, particularly sales and customer-facing teams that need meeting insights flowing into CRMs and project tools automatically. Its broader integration ecosystem and generous free tier make it the more versatile platform. At $19/month per user, it's a solid investment for any team that lives in meetings.

**Otter.ai** excels as a personal and small-team transcription tool. Its real-time transcript is the fastest in the market, live collaboration features are genuinely unique, and the Pro plan at $16.99/month is the most affordable premium option. It's ideal for individuals, journalists, and teams that prioritize the live meeting experience over post-meeting workflows.

For sales teams and workflow-heavy organizations, go with Fireflies. For individual professionals and real-time collaboration, go with Otter. Both free plans are generous enough to run a meaningful trial before committing.
