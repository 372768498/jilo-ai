## FAQ

### Which produces better images?

Midjourney generally produces more aesthetically stunning images with better lighting, composition, and artistic coherence right out of the box. Leonardo AI offers more control over the output and competitive quality, especially with the right model selection. For pure "wow factor," Midjourney typically wins.

### Do I need Discord to use Midjourney?

Midjourney originally required Discord, but now offers a web interface (alpha) for direct generation. Some features still work best through Discord. Leonardo AI has always offered a full web application, making it more accessible for users who prefer a traditional UI.

### Can I train custom models?

Leonardo AI allows you to train custom models using your own image datasets, which is powerful for creating consistent brand imagery or personal art styles. Midjourney does not offer custom model training but supports style references using uploaded images.

### Which is better for commercial use?

Both platforms allow commercial use on paid plans. Midjourney's output quality often requires less post-processing for commercial work. Leonardo AI's custom models and ControlNet features give more precise control for specific commercial needs like product photography.

### Can I generate consistent characters?

Both tools have improved character consistency, but Leonardo AI's ControlNet and custom model training give it an edge for maintaining character appearance across multiple images. Midjourney's character reference feature (--cref) also helps but offers less precise control.
