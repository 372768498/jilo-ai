## FAQ

### Can I achieve Midjourney-level quality with Stable Diffusion?

Yes, but it requires technical knowledge, proper model selection, and parameter optimization. Community-trained models like SDXL and specialized checkpoints can produce quality comparable to Midjourney, though often requiring more effort to achieve consistent results.

### Is it legal to use AI-generated images commercially?

Both platforms allow commercial use under different terms. Stable Diffusion provides unrestricted commercial rights, while Midjourney requires appropriate subscription plans and adherence to their terms of service. Always verify current licensing terms for your specific use case.

### Which tool is better for beginners?

Midjourney is significantly more beginner-friendly due to its Discord interface, automatic optimization, and minimal technical requirements. Stable Diffusion requires technical setup and knowledge but offers unlimited learning and experimentation opportunities.

### Can I train custom styles on both platforms?

Only Stable Diffusion supports custom model training and style development through techniques like LoRA, DreamBooth, and Textual Inversion. Midjourney offers style control through parameters and references but doesn't allow custom model training.

### What are the hardware requirements for running Stable Diffusion?

Minimum 8GB VRAM GPU (RTX 3070/4060) for basic usage, with 12GB+ recommended for comfortable generation speeds. High-end GPUs (RTX 4090, A100) provide professional-level performance. CPU and RAM requirements are modest compared to GPU demands.
