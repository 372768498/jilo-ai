## FAQ

### Which produces better-looking videos?
Both produce professional videos, but in different styles. Pictory's stock footage videos look like polished social content. Synthesia's avatar videos look like professional presentations. Neither looks "AI-generated" to casual viewers.

### Can I use my own footage in both?
Pictory lets you upload your own footage and mix it with stock media. Synthesia primarily uses AI avatars but supports screen recordings and uploaded backgrounds.

### Which is better for YouTube?
Pictory is generally better for YouTube, especially for faceless channels that repurpose written content. Synthesia works for educational YouTube channels that want a consistent presenter.

### Do I need video editing skills?
Neither requires video editing skills. Pictory is slightly easier — just paste your text and it generates video. Synthesia requires writing a script for the avatar to present.

### Can I translate videos into other languages?
Synthesia is superior for multilingual content with lip-synced avatars in 140+ languages. Pictory supports subtitles in multiple languages but doesn't offer lip-sync translation.

## Final Verdict

**Pictory** is ideal for content marketers who want to repurpose written content into engaging videos quickly and affordably. **Synthesia** is the better choice for organizations that need professional presenter-led videos for training, communications, or multilingual content.
