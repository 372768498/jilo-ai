## FAQ

### Which AI image generator has better text rendering?

Ideogram is the clear winner for text rendering. It can accurately produce multi-line text, varied fonts, and complex typography within images. Midjourney has improved its text capabilities in recent versions but still struggles with consistency, especially for longer text or specific font styles.

### Can Midjourney generate logos?

Midjourney can generate logo concepts, and many designers use it for initial inspiration. However, the text elements in logos are often inaccurate, requiring post-editing. Ideogram is generally more reliable for logo design because it handles text accurately and produces cleaner graphic design outputs.

### Which is better for social media content?

It depends on the type of content. For visually stunning photos, artistic backgrounds, and aesthetic-driven posts, Midjourney produces superior results. For social media graphics that include text overlays, branded content, and designed posts with captions, Ideogram is more practical and reliable.

### Do both tools allow commercial use?

Yes, both Midjourney and Ideogram grant commercial usage rights on their paid plans. Midjourney requires a paid subscription for commercial use, while Ideogram's free tier has limited commercial rights — you'll need a paid plan for full commercial licensing.

### Can I use both tools together in a design workflow?

Many professional designers use both tools complementarily. They might generate a stunning background or photorealistic element in Midjourney, then create text-heavy overlays or branded elements in Ideogram, combining the outputs in Figma or Photoshop for the final design.
