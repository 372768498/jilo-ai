## Overview

Notion AI and Obsidian represent two fundamentally different approaches to knowledge management in 2026. Notion is a cloud-based, all-in-one workspace with built-in AI capabilities for writing, summarization, and automation. Obsidian is a local-first, markdown-based knowledge base that empowers users with full data ownership and a powerful plugin ecosystem. This comparison helps knowledge workers, students, and teams choose the right tool for their workflow.

## FAQ

### Can Obsidian match Notion's AI features?

With community plugins, Obsidian can connect to OpenAI, Claude, or local models like Ollama, giving you powerful AI assistance. However, it requires setup and configuration. Notion's AI is plug-and-play and deeply integrated into the workspace. For non-technical users, Notion AI is more accessible.

### Is Obsidian really free?

Yes, Obsidian is completely free for personal use with no feature limitations — all plugins, themes, and core features are included. You only pay for optional add-on services: Sync ($4/month) and Publish ($8/month). Commercial use requires a $50/user/year license.

### Can I migrate between Notion and Obsidian?

Yes, migration in both directions is possible. Notion exports to markdown, which Obsidian reads natively. Obsidian's markdown files can be imported into Notion. However, Notion's database features and AI blocks don't translate to markdown, so some content restructuring is needed.

### Which is better for students?

Both are popular with students. Obsidian excels for long-term knowledge building and connecting ideas across courses (great for research and thesis work). Notion is better for project organization, group work, and maintaining structured course databases. Many students use both.

### Can Notion work offline?

Notion has limited offline support — you can view and edit recently opened pages, but it requires internet for full functionality, search, and AI features. Obsidian works entirely offline with no limitations, making it ideal for users who need reliable offline access.
