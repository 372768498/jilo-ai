## FAQ

### Can Canva replace Figma for UI design?

For simple websites and basic interfaces, Canva can suffice. However, Figma is purpose-built for UI/UX design with features like Auto Layout, components, variables, and Dev Mode that Canva simply doesn't offer. Professional product teams should use Figma.

### Is Figma overkill for social media graphics?

Yes, for most social media content creation, Figma is unnecessarily complex. Canva's templates, Magic Resize, and direct social publishing make it far more efficient for marketing graphics. Figma is better reserved for product and interface design.

### Can I use both tools together?

Absolutely — many teams do. Designers use Figma for product UI/UX work and Canva for marketing materials, social media, and presentations. This combination leverages each tool's strengths without compromise.

### Which has better AI features?

Canva currently has more comprehensive AI features integrated directly into the design workflow — Magic Design, Magic Write, text-to-image, and AI photo editing. Figma's AI features are more focused on productivity within the design tool rather than content generation.

### Is Figma free for individual use?

Figma offers a free plan with up to 3 Figma files and 3 FigJam files, which is enough for freelancers or individuals working on small projects. Canva's free plan is more generous with access to 250,000+ templates and basic features.
