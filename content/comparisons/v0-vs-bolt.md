## FAQ

### Can v0 generate full applications or just components?

v0 has evolved significantly and can now generate multi-page applications, not just individual components. However, its strength remains in producing high-quality, production-ready UI components and pages. For complex full-stack applications with backend logic, Bolt.new may be more suitable.

### Does Bolt.new really run everything in the browser?

Yes. Bolt.new uses StackBlitz's WebContainers technology, which runs a full Node.js environment directly in your browser. This means you can install npm packages, run build tools, and execute server-side code without any local installation. It's a genuine development environment, not just a code editor.

### Which tool is better for non-developers?

Both are accessible to non-developers, but v0 has a slight edge for beginners because of its focused, chat-based interface. You describe what you want, and it generates polished code. Bolt.new's full IDE can be overwhelming if you're not familiar with development environments, but it also provides more power once you get comfortable.

### Can I export code from both tools to use in my own projects?

Yes. v0 generates standard React/Next.js code that you can copy directly into your project or deploy to Vercel. Bolt.new lets you download your entire project as a zip file or push to a Git repository, giving you full ownership of the generated code.

### Which is better for a startup MVP?

For a React/Next.js MVP with polished UI that needs to ship fast on Vercel, choose v0. For a full-stack MVP that needs database integration, API endpoints, and flexibility in technology choices, choose Bolt.new. Many startup teams use both — v0 for rapid UI prototyping and Bolt.new for building out the full application.
