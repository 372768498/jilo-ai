## FAQ

### Is Make really cheaper than Zapier?

Yes, Make is significantly more affordable for most use cases. Make's Core plan at ~$10/month includes 10,000 operations, while Zapier's comparable Professional plan at ~$30/month includes only 750 tasks. The exact cost difference depends on your workflow complexity (a single Zap task might equal multiple Make operations), but Make generally offers 3-5x more value per dollar.

### Can Zapier handle complex automations?

Yes, Zapier has expanded well beyond simple linear automations. With Paths (branching), Looping, Sub-Zaps, Tables, and Code steps, Zapier can handle moderately complex workflows. However, for highly complex scenarios with multiple branches, advanced error handling, and intricate data transformations, Make's visual builder is more powerful and easier to manage.

### Which platform has better AI integration?

Zapier currently leads in AI integration with its natural language Zap creation, built-in AI actions (summarize, classify, extract), and AI Copilot. Both platforms offer native modules for ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI services, but Zapier has made AI a core part of the platform experience rather than just another integration.

### Can I migrate from Zapier to Make (or vice versa)?

There's no automatic migration tool between the platforms. You'll need to rebuild your workflows manually. However, both platforms' visual interfaces make it relatively straightforward to recreate automations. Many users run both platforms simultaneously during transition, gradually moving workflows over time.

### Which is better for e-commerce automation?

Both are excellent for e-commerce. Zapier has more native integrations with e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce) and is faster to set up common automations like order notifications or inventory syncing. Make is better for complex e-commerce workflows that involve data transformation, multi-platform synchronization, or custom business logic that requires advanced routing.
