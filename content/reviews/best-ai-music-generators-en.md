## FAQ

### 1. Can AI-generated music be used commercially without copyright issues?

Yes, but with important caveats. Platforms like Suno Pro, Udio Pro, and Stable Audio provide full commercial rights to generated music. However, the legal landscape is still evolving. For high-value commercial projects, consider additional legal review. Some platforms offer indemnification against copyright claims, but this varies by provider. Always check the specific terms of service and consider the risk level of your project.

### 2. How does AI-generated music quality compare to human-created music?

The quality gap has largely disappeared for certain genres and styles. Suno and Udio can produce vocals virtually indistinguishable from human singers. Instrumental quality varies by tool and genre - AIVA excels at classical music that rivals human composers, while Stable Audio creates professional electronic music. However, AI still struggles with highly complex arrangements, emotional nuance in lyrics, and innovative musical concepts that require true creativity.

### 3. Which AI music tool is best for beginners?

Suno offers the best beginner experience with its simple text-to-song interface. You can create complete songs by describing what you want in plain English. Boomy is even simpler but produces lower quality results. For those wanting more control, Stable Audio provides good results with straightforward prompts for instrumental music. Avoid AIVA initially unless you have classical music knowledge.

### 4. Can I use AI music tools to create backing tracks for live performances?

Absolutely. Many musicians use AI tools to create backing tracks, practice tracks, and demo versions. Suno's stem separation feature allows you to isolate vocals, drums, or other elements. Stable Audio excels at creating instrumental backing tracks. AIVA works well for orchestral backing tracks. Always ensure you have proper commercial licensing if performing publicly or selling recordings.

### 5. How much can I expect to pay monthly for professional AI music generation?

For professional use, expect $10-20/month. Suno Pro ($10/month) and Udio Pro ($10/month) offer the best value for complete song creation with commercial rights. Stable Audio ($12/month) is excellent for instrumental work. AIVA ($15/month) is worth it for classical and film music. Soundraw ($20/month) provides unlimited licensing. Budget options like Boomy ($3/month) exist but with significant quality trade-offs.
