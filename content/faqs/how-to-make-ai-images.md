# How to Make AI Images: Guide to Midjourney, DALL-E, Leonardo & Stable Diffusion

AI image generation has gone from experimental to essential. Designers, marketers, content creators, and hobbyists are using AI to create everything from social media graphics to product mockups. If you're curious about getting started, this guide covers the top tools and how to use them effectively.

## The Short Answer

To make AI images, you write a text description (called a "prompt") and an AI model generates an image based on it. The top tools in 2026 are **Midjourney** (best artistic quality), **DALL-E** (easiest to use via ChatGPT), **Leonardo AI** (best free option), and **Stable Diffusion** (most customizable, runs locally). Each has strengths — your choice depends on your needs and budget.

## The Top Tools Compared

### Midjourney

**What it is:** The gold standard for artistic AI images. Known for stunning, stylized outputs that often look better than what you'd get from stock photography.

**How to access:** Through Discord or the Midjourney web app (alpha).

**Strengths:** Exceptional aesthetic quality, great at landscapes, portraits, and fantasy art. Consistent results even with simple prompts.

**Pricing:** Plans start at $10/month for ~200 images.

**Best for:** Creatives, designers, and anyone who wants beautiful images without complex prompting.

### DALL-E (via ChatGPT)

**What it is:** OpenAI's image generator, built directly into ChatGPT. The most accessible option — just ask ChatGPT to create an image.

**How to access:** Through ChatGPT (Plus or free tier with limits).

**Strengths:** Incredibly easy to use. Great at following specific instructions, text rendering in images, and iterating on designs through conversation.

**Pricing:** Included with ChatGPT Plus ($20/month). Limited free generations available.

**Best for:** Non-designers who want quick images without learning a new tool.

### Leonardo AI

**What it is:** A versatile AI art platform with a generous free tier and powerful customization options.

**How to access:** Web app at leonardo.ai.

**Strengths:** Excellent free tier (150 daily tokens), multiple model options, strong at game art and character design, canvas editing tools.

**Pricing:** Free tier available. Paid plans from $10/month.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious creators and game designers who want variety without paying.

### Stable Diffusion

**What it is:** An open-source image generation model you can run on your own computer. Maximum flexibility and privacy.

**How to access:** Install locally via ComfyUI or Automatic1111, or use cloud services like RunPod.

**Strengths:** Completely free (if run locally), unlimited generations, full control over models and settings, massive community of fine-tuned models.

**Pricing:** Free (requires a GPU with 8GB+ VRAM) or cloud GPU rental (~$0.50/hour).

**Best for:** Technical users who want full control, privacy, or need to generate large volumes.

## How to Write Better Image Prompts

The quality of your AI images depends heavily on your prompts. Here's a framework:

### The Prompt Formula

**Subject + Style + Details + Technical specs**

Example: *"A cozy coffee shop interior, warm golden lighting, rain visible through large windows, watercolor painting style, soft colors, detailed"*

### Tips for Better Prompts

1. **Be specific about style.** Say "oil painting," "photorealistic," "anime style," or "minimalist vector illustration" — don't leave it vague.
2. **Describe lighting.** "Golden hour," "dramatic shadows," "soft diffused light" — lighting transforms the mood.
3. **Include composition details.** "Close-up," "bird's eye view," "wide angle," "centered composition."
4. **Use negative prompts.** Most tools let you specify what you *don't* want: "no text," "no watermarks," "no blurry elements."
5. **Iterate, don't perfect.** Generate multiple versions and refine. Your first prompt rarely produces the best result.

## Practical Tips for Real-World Use

- **Social media content:** Use DALL-E in ChatGPT for quick blog thumbnails and social posts.
- **Brand assets:** Use Midjourney for high-quality visuals that match a specific aesthetic.
- **Prototyping:** Use Leonardo to quickly visualize product concepts or UI designs.
- **Bulk generation:** Use Stable Diffusion locally when you need hundreds of variations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use AI images commercially?
Yes, with caveats. Midjourney, DALL-E, and Leonardo all allow commercial use on paid plans. Stable Diffusion outputs are generally unrestricted. Always check the specific terms of service for your use case.

### Will AI replace graphic designers?
No. AI is a tool that designers use, not a replacement. Professional design requires strategic thinking, brand understanding, and creative direction that AI can't provide alone. The best results come from designers who use AI to accelerate their workflow.

### How do I avoid AI images looking "AI-ish"?
Use specific, detailed prompts. Avoid generic descriptions. Add imperfections ("slight film grain," "natural lighting"). Use inpainting to fix obvious AI artifacts. And always curate — not every generation is worth using.

### Which tool has the best free tier?
Leonardo AI offers the most generous free tier with 150 daily tokens. DALL-E gives a few free generations through ChatGPT. Stable Diffusion is entirely free if you have the hardware.

### Do I need a powerful computer?
Only for Stable Diffusion. All other tools run in the cloud — you just need a web browser. For Stable Diffusion, an NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM is recommended.

## Conclusion

AI image generation is now accessible to everyone, not just designers or technical users. Whether you choose Midjourney for artistic quality, DALL-E for convenience, Leonardo for its free tier, or Stable Diffusion for full control, the key is to start experimenting. Write descriptive prompts, generate lots of variations, and refine. The more you practice, the better your results will be — and you'll quickly wonder how you ever created content without it.
