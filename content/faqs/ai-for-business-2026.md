### What's the biggest mistake companies make with AI implementation?
Trying to do too much too quickly. Successful AI adoption requires starting with focused pilot projects, learning from them, and gradually expanding AI use across the organization.

### Do we need to hire AI specialists to implement business AI?
Not necessarily. Many AI tools are designed for business users, not technical specialists. However, having someone with AI literacy to guide implementation and vendor selection is valuable.
