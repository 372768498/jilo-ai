- Credit scoring AI that discriminates based on zip code or name

**What's being done:**
- Bias auditing and red-teaming of AI systems
- Diverse training data initiatives
- Regulatory requirements for algorithmic fairness
- Transparency reports from major AI companies

### 4. Job Displacement

**The risk:** AI automation may eliminate certain types of jobs faster than new ones are created.

**Most affected areas:**
- Data entry and basic administrative tasks
- Simple content writing and translation
- Basic customer service
- Some aspects of coding, design, and analysis

**The nuance:**
- AI typically automates *tasks*, not entire jobs
- New job categories are emerging (prompt engineering, AI training, AI ethics)
- Historical pattern: technology displaces some jobs while creating others
- The transition period is the critical challenge

**What's being done:**
- Government retraining programs
- Companies investing in upskilling initiatives
- Educational institutions updating curricula
- Universal basic income discussions in some countries

### 5. AI Hallucinations and Reliability

**The risk:** AI systems can generate confident-sounding but completely false information.

**Why it matters:**
- Students using incorrect AI-generated facts in academic work
- Professionals making decisions based on fabricated data
- Legal cases where AI-generated citations turned out to be fake
- Medical information that could be dangerous if followed blindly

**What's being done:**
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground AI in real data
- Improved training techniques to reduce hallucinations
- User education about verifying AI outputs
- Citation and source features in AI tools
