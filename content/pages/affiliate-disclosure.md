# Affiliate Disclosure

## How Jilo.ai Makes Money

Jilo.ai is a free resource for discovering and comparing AI tools. To keep our content free and high-quality, we participate in affiliate programs with some of the tools we review.

## What This Means

When you click on certain links on our site and make a purchase, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you. This helps us:

- Keep the site running
- Continue researching new AI tools
- Maintain accurate, up-to-date information

## Our Editorial Policy

**Our recommendations are never influenced by affiliate relationships.**

- We only recommend tools we've actually tested
- Negative reviews don't get changed for affiliate partners
- Many tools we recommend don't have affiliate programs at all
- Our rankings are based on features, pricing, and user feedback — not commission rates

## Affiliate Partners

We currently participate in affiliate programs with:

- Synthesia
- Jasper
- Surfer SEO
- *(and others)*

## Questions?

If you have questions about our affiliate relationships, contact us at hello@jilo.ai.
