# I Compared 70+ AI Tools So You Don't Have To

After months of testing AI tools, I got frustrated. Every "Best AI Tools" article was either:
- A thinly-veiled ad for one product
- Outdated by the time I read it
- Missing the tools I actually cared about

So I built [Jilo.ai](https://jilo.ai) — a free, constantly-updated AI tools directory with honest comparisons.

## What I Learned Testing 70+ Tools

### 🖥️ Best AI Coding Tools

| Tool | Best For | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Cursor** | All-around AI IDE | $20/mo |
| **GitHub Copilot** | VS Code users | $10/mo |
| **Claude Code** | Complex refactoring | $20/mo (Max) |
| **Windsurf** | Free alternative | Free tier |

## The Surprising Findings

1. **Free tiers are more generous than you think.** Claude, Gemini, and Leonardo AI all have solid free options.

2. **The "best" tool depends entirely on your use case.** ChatGPT wins for general tasks, Claude wins for writing, Cursor wins for coding.

3. **Most people only need 2-3 AI tools.** Don't subscribe to everything.

4. **Prices change constantly.** This is why I built a directory that stays updated.
