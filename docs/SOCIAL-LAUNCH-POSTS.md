### Comparison Thread

🧵 I compared every major AI coding tool so you don't have to.

Here's what I found after testing Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Windsurf, and more:

1/ Cursor — Best all-around IDE experience
2/ GitHub Copilot — Best for existing VS Code users  
3/ Claude Code — Best for complex refactoring
4/ Windsurf — Best free option

### Value Post

Stop paying for AI tools you don't need.

I reviewed 70+ AI tools and found that for most people:

Writing → Claude (free tier is generous)
Coding → Cursor (worth the $20/mo)
Images → Leonardo AI (free tier = 150/day)
Video → CapCut (free + powerful)
Search → Perplexity (free tier is enough)

🔍 After reviewing 70+ AI tools, here's what I learned:

Most businesses are overpaying for AI tools they don't fully use.

No signup. No paywall. Just useful information.
