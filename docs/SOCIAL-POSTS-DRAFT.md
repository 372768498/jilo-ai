## Reddit — r/artificial

**Title:** I built a free AI tool comparison site with expert reviews — Jilo.ai

**Body:**
Hey everyone! I've been working on Jilo.ai, a free platform to discover and compare AI tools.

**What it does:**
- 70+ AI tools with detailed reviews
- Side-by-side comparisons (ChatGPT vs Claude, Midjourney vs DALL-E, etc.)
- "Best AI Tools" lists for different use cases (coding, writing, design, startups)
- Alternatives finder (e.g., "ChatGPT alternatives")
- Updated daily with AI news

**Why I built it:**
I was frustrated by the existing AI directories that just list tools without real analysis. Most are pay-to-rank. Jilo.ai is 100% free, no registration required, and focuses on honest, in-depth reviews.

**Tech stack:** Next.js, Supabase, Vercel

Would love your feedback! What AI tools or comparisons would you like to see?

- Head-to-head comparisons (ChatGPT vs Claude, Cursor vs Copilot, etc.)
- "Best tools for" guides by use case

It's free, no registration, and focuses on honest analysis rather than pay-to-rank.
